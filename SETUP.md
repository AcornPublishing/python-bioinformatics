# Setup Instructions

## Mac

Use Terminal or iTerm2.

## Windows

### Native shells: cmd.exe, Powershell

Works if you prefix commands with "python".

### Git Bash

A partial Unix-like shell that works fairly well, still need to prefix commands with "python."

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

This is my recommended option.
